# Week 11: Note Taker App ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  ## Description
  This week, our assignment was to take a note-taking app and add back-end routes to it so it can function. Essentially the primary goal was to create a 'database' of inputted notes and use the routes to allow the front-end application to interact with the database.

  Overall, this assignment was pretty simple. Most of the syntax and script is pretty intuitive in terms of creating the route, and making sure all the right methods were being called was more an issue of memory than of logistics. In fact, the biggest issue I'd run into was forgetting to implement middleware for JSON object encoding, which took up a bulk of my time trying to resolve before I'd remembered what I needed.

  What was fascinating working with this project was really getting to see how front-end and back-end communicate with each other across what seems to be almost completely different mediums. After having only started Javascript as a single js file sharing information with itself, watching and implementing code that allowed that info to be imported and exported in different fashions is interesting. There's definitely a lot of OOP involved in the project, so I'm glad we're still building on that.

  I wasn't able to get the DELETE route to work. The functionality is kind of there as the delete request is being reflected in the db.json, so I don't know if there is a referential variable I'm not utilizing. Hopefully I can address that in a later update.
